# On The Sunny Side

This website is for all users who are planning to take some winter holidays, in a sunny destination, while the weather is cold. The website is colorful and motivating, offering to inspire its users to check out 3 different destinations and learn about them and their climate. The users can than submit an enquire form to ask for a quote. 

The On The Sunny Side website is designed to give potential customers inspiration and informative details and pictures about the sunny holiday destinations where it is offering tours during the cold winter months. This means the site needs to be responsive, allowing visiters to view on any device without quality of experience suffering. The main focus of the site is to be engaging, colourful, motivating while providing useful information about the featured destination's climate. The customers can also submit an enquire form to ask for a quote for their dream holiday.

#### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for headings and the navigation menu is Poiret One, this was chosen as it's easily readible, stylish with a little fun and aims to give the idea of a modern and clean designs.

The secondary font used for the body is Montserrat which was selected for its clear readibility, that yet works well with Poiret One to maintain an elegant outcome.
