The website is colorful and motivating, offering to inspire its users to check out 3 different destinations and learn about them and their climate.

### Ideal client


The ideal client for this business is:

- English speaking.

Visitors to this website are searching for:

- An experienced travel agency to create a personalised trip for their ultimate holiday experience.

This website is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

- Most tours at other agencies are limited in terms of their packages and availabilities. 
- On different travel agnecy websites it is difficult to choose between their options while people can prefer some features from option A but some from any other options too. They however wouldn't have the opportunity to combine those.

This website is:

- Easy to navigate due to its sticky navbar that scrolls with the user on every pages.
- Social media sites in footer, open up in new tabs in order to not to distract the customers away from the website.
- Gives the customers options and access to useful and learnable information.
- Gives the customers the information they need without overloading them or distract them from their original ideas
  or wishes.
- Guiding them and their curiosity to the goal of the website - to fill out the enquiry form and so start a conversation.

  can send their full enquiry.

# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing website.

Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile have scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse](readme-images/accessibility_lighthouse_mobile%26desktop.png "Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

- Peachpuff #ffdab9
- Very dark grayish cyan #353838
- Very dark grayish pink #4d4044
- Whitesmoke #f5f5f5, #ffffff

![My Colour Palette](readme-images/colorkit.png "My Colour Palette")

[My Colour Palette](https://colorkit.co/palette/f5f5f5-ffdab9-4d4044-353838/)

I chose these colours apart from efficient contrasting to compliment my photos' blues, greens and purples and their ambiance that they give to the viewer. 

The primary colour is Peachpuff which is a pale orange colour that gives the ambiance of sunny summer day and some could associat with the sand, as well as putting us in a light feel. The purply-brown texts proved great contrast to peachpuff and gave consistency throughout the project.

I also used some white and whitesmoke colours to further elevate the feeling of the website and with decreased opacity here and there increase its elegancy, as well. 

### Typography


I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for headings and the navigation menu is Poiret One, this was chosen as it's easily readible, stylish with a little fun and aims to give the idea of a modern and clean designs. 

![Poiret One Font](readme-images/poiret-one.png "Poiret One Font")

The secondary font used for the body is Montserrat which was selected for its clear readibility, that yet works well with Poiret One to maintain an elegant outcome.

# Languages Used


HTML, and CSS were used to complete this project.

# Technologies Used


- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for all icons on the pages
- Github was used to store all files for this website
- Gitpod was used to create and edit all original code
- Google Chrome Developer Tools was used for debugging and testing with Lighthouse
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import both fonts for use on the site

# Features

The On The Sunny Side website includes five main pages; Home, Destinations - Morocco, Destinations - Barbados, Destinations - Dubai and Enquire Now. All the pages are all accessible through the navigation menu shown at the top of the screen. This navigation menu also contains a Contact button next to the Home button that takes the customer to the bottom of the page, on every page, to reveal the contact information of the business. The navigation bar contains a logo as well, on the left side that will take the customer back to the Home page in every case. 


#### The pages include:

A navigation bar that allows the customers to navigate to each of the main pages of the site. The navigation bar is fixed so it will follow the customer scrolling down the pages, giving them easier access to navigate again. It is also slightly seethrough to make the tab stand out and give an elegant touch to its design.
The page the viewer is currently on is displayed with a different background colour and an over and underline as well to show which page is active. Upon hovering over each of the navigation menu links they'll also be changing their backgrounds and will be over and underlined to show the viewer where they are clicking. 
The navigation bar is responsive meaning that it decreases in size, as well as the menu section will also appear underneath the logo if viewed on smaller screen sizes. This is to streamline the appearance of the navigation bar and reduce clutter on tablet and mobile screens.

A footer is displayed at the bottom of each page which displays the contact information of the business, Copyright information with a disclaimer and social media links to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube for the viewers to be able to be get in contact with the business on more platforms.

#### Home

The Home page features a hero image, that is very inviting as a dreamy beach photo. It has the header - navigation bar displayed as an overlay, that is also seethrough a little bit. The hero image also has a cover text on it with a motto text. This oval shape and text zooms out each time when the page loads. The purpose of these elements are to give a great first impression on arriving at the website, with an elegant and luxurious feel to it.

After the hero image there is a marketing and explanetory text that tells the customers what the business do.

After this section there is an other photo inserted, featuring a camera, a beach bag, a book and shells for inspirational purposes. 

#### Destinations pages

The three Destinations pages; Morocco, Barbados and Dubai both contains a page title, stating which destination is the current page about.
Next to the title, the pages features a gallery section to give information and idea to the potential customers about each destinations without overwhelming them at the same time. These galleries are organised into a 3D rotating carousel for desktop screens and into a more simple fade out carousel for smaller screens to be able to fit and therefore enjoy the photos on a smaller screen too, one by one.

After this section there is an inspirational photo of the given destination, as well as an informative paragraph next to it. On smaller screens the paragraph will go underneath the picture.

#### Enquire Now 

The page features an other hero image that is about a beautiful sunset over the beach and ocean with its waves. Apart from inspirational and motivational reasons it also symbolises the final step. That is to fill out the enquiry form to get a quote. 

Then there is the enquiry form box, that I designed to be able to be submitted only when all boxes are filled out or selected and in the correct way. The submit button changes its colour after being pressed to give assurance to the customer.

   - The logo always leads back to the home page.

2. As a potential new customer to the website, I want to see a gallery that shows what I could do or visit in 
   each destinations if I decide to travel there.
   - When the viewer clicks on each Destination pages, those will always start with an interactive gallery, positioned to be on top of the pages and the first content for those pages. 
   - With the fixed navbar the opportunity, to navigate from one page to another, is always at the user's disposal. They can jump between the destination options easily at all times.

## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and report any issues they find. Position of the text in cover-text was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page. They also reported it that the dropdown menu doesn't work in an efficient way when viewed on mobile screens with Safari browser. Instead of a simple tap, we have to press the button for a longer period of time in order to drop down. In every other case it worked perfectly, on Safari desktop screen size also.

## Bugs

The dropdown menu issue on mobile screens when browsing with Safari I couldn't resolve unfortunately. It will be a future ambition to resolve this problem.
