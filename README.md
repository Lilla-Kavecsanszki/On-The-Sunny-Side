# On The Sunny Side

This website is for all users who are planning to take some winter holidays, in a sunny destination, while the weather is cold. The website is colorful and motivating, offering to inspire its users to check out 3 different destinations and learn about them and their climate. The users can than submit an enquire form to ask for a quote. 

The On The Sunny Side website is designed to give potential customers inspiration and informative details and pictures about the sunny holiday destinations where it is offering tours during the cold winter months. This means the site needs to be responsive, allowing visiters to view on any device without quality of experience suffering. The main focus of the site is to be engaging, colourful, motivating while providing useful information about the featured destination's climate. The customers can also submit an enquire form to ask for a quote for their dream holiday.

## Accessibility

Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing website.

I tested all pages of my site using [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) and have no errors on any page.
Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile have scored 100% for accessibility on both

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.
