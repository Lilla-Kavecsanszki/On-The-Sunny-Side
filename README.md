# On The Sunny Side

This website is for all users who are planning to take some winter holidays, in a sunny destination, while the weather is cold. The website is colorful and motivating, offering to inspire its users to check out 3 different destinations and learn about them and their climate. The users can than submit an enquire form to ask for a quote. 

The On The Sunny Side website is designed to give potential customers inspiration and informative details and pictures about the sunny holiday destinations where it is offering tours during the cold winter months. This means the site needs to be responsive, allowing visiters to view on any device without quality of experience suffering. The main focus of the site is to be engaging, colourful, motivating while providing useful information about the featured destination's climate. The customers can also submit an enquire form to ask for a quote for their dream holiday.

# User Experience (UX)


### Ideal client


The ideal client for this business is:

- English speaking.
- Has disposable income.
- Likes to travel abroad.
- Primarily people who lives in the UK (but can be anywhere in the world).
- Individual, Couples, Families or Groups

Visitors to this website are searching for:

- An experienced travel agency to create a personalised trip for their ultimate holiday experience.

This website is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

- Most tours at other agencies are limited in terms of their packages and availabilities. 
- On different travel agnecy websites it is difficult to choose between their options while people can prefer some  
  features from option A but some from any other options too. They however wouldn't have the opportunity to combine those.

This website is:

- Easy to navigate due to its sticky navbar that scrolls with the user on every pages.
- Social media sites in footer, open up in new tabs in order to not to distract the customers away from the website.
- Gives the customers options and access to useful and learnable information.
- Gives the customers the information they need without overloading them or distract them from their original ideas
  or wishes.
- Guiding them and their curiosity to the goal of the website - to fill out the enquiry form and so start a conversation.
- The submit button on the enquiry form flags all information boxes that the customer might forgot to fill out before they 
  can send their full enquiry. 

# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing website.

I tested all pages of my site using [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) and have no errors on any page.
Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile have scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse](assets/images/README/Accessibility_Lighthouse_mobile%26desktop.png "Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

### Typography


I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the following fonts to the site.

The primary font used for headings and the navigation menu is Poiret One, this was chosen as it's easily readible, stylish with a little fun and aims to give the idea of a modern and clean designs.

The secondary font used for the body is Montserrat which was selected for its clear readibility, that yet works well with Poiret One to maintain an elegant outcome.

# Features

The On The Sunny Side website includes five main pages, Home, Destinations - Morocco, Destinations - Barbados, Destinations - Dubai and Enquire Now. All the pages are all accessible through the navigation menu shown at the top of the screen. This navigation menu also contains a Contact button next to the Home button that takes the customer to the bottom of the page, on every page, to reveale the contact information of the business. The navigation bar contains a logo as well, on the left side that will take the customer back to the Home page in every case. 


The pages include:

A navigation bar that allows the customers to navigate to each of the main pages of the site. The navigation bar is fixed so it will follow the customer scrolling down the pages, giving them easier access to navigate again. It is also slightly seethrough to make the tab stand out and give an elegant touch to its design.
The page the viewer is currently on is displayed with a different background colour and an over and underline as well to show which page is active. Upon hovering over each of the navigation menu links they'll also be changing their backgrounds and will be over and underlined to show the viewer where they are clicking. 
The navigation bar is responsive meaning that it decreases in size, as well as the menu section will also appear underneath the logo if viewed on smaller screen sizes. This is to streamline the appearance of the navigation bar and reduce clutter on tablet and mobile screens.

A footer is displayed at the bottom of each page which displays the contact information of the business, Copyright information with a disclaimer and social media links to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube for the viewers to be able to be get in contact with the business on more platforms.
