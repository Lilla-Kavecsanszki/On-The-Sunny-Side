                    <p>Dubai has a hot desert climate. Dubai has 4 seasons – winter, spring, fall, and summer. Summer in
                        Dubai
                        begins around the last week of April and ends around the first week of October. This period is
                        characterized
                        by extremely hot weather, hot winds and high humidity. Due to the city's close proximity to the
                        sea, the
                        temperatures in Dubai are slightly milder in summer in comparison to other Gulf cities such as
                        Kuwait City
                        and Riyadh. However, this means the city has high humidity which can make the weather extremely
                        unpleasant in
                        summer. Rainfall is scarce during the summer months, but the windy conditions ensure there are
                        frequent dust
                        storms. Temperatures regularly climb above 38 °C (100 °F) during this period and fall to around
                        26 °C (79 °F)
                        overnight.

                        Winter in Dubai begins around the last week of October and lasts until the beginning of April.
                        The
                        winter season has the most pleasant weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities. Most of the
                        precipitation
                        takes place during this season. Strong thunderstorms are not uncommon to the city during this
                        period, this is
                        accompanied by strong north-westerly winds and lower temperatures. The Average daytime high
                        during the winter
                        season is around 22 °C (72 °F) with overnight lows of 12 °C (54 °F). Rainfall has been
                        increasing over the past
                        few decades in the city accumulating to more than 130 mm (5.12 in) per year.

                        The urban heat island effect does take its toll on Dubai as well, for example during the winter
                        months
                        when temperatures regularly fall to around 5 °C (41 °F) and lower in the outskirts of the city
                        and its
                        suburbs, the temperatures in Central Dubai rarely fall below 7 °C (45 °F). This can be clearly
                        seen
                        when comparing weather data from the city's two airports - Dubai International and Dubai World
                        Central.
                        The highest temperature recorded in Dubai is 49.0 °C (120 °F), reached in July 2019,[1] whereas
                        the
                        lowest recorded
