                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Dubai has a hot desert climate. Dubai has 4 seasons – winter, spring, fall, and summer. Summer in Dubai 
                begins around the last week of April and ends around the first week of October. This period is characterized 
                by extremely hot weather, hot winds and high humidity. Due to the city's close proximity to the sea, the 
                temperatures in Dubai are slightly milder in summer in comparison to other Gulf cities such as Kuwait City 
                and Riyadh. However, this means the city has high humidity which can make the weather extremely unpleasant in 
                summer. Rainfall is scarce during the summer months, but the windy conditions ensure there are frequent dust 
                storms. Temperatures regularly climb above 38 °C (100 °F) during this period and fall to around 26 °C (79 °F) 
                overnight. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Winter in Dubai begins around the last week of October and lasts until the beginning of April. The 
                winter season has the most pleasant weather, making it ideal for outdoor activities. Most of the precipitation 
                takes place during this season. Strong thunderstorms are not uncommon to the city during this period, this is 
                accompanied by strong north-westerly winds and lower temperatures. The Average daytime high during the winter 
                season is around 22 °C (72 °F) with overnight lows of 12 °C (54 °F). Rainfall has been increasing over the past 
                few decades in the city accumulating to more than 130 mm (5.12 in) per year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The urban heat island effect does take its toll on Dubai as well, for example during the winter months 
                    when temperatures regularly fall to around 5 °C (41 °F) and lower in the outskirts of the city and its 
                    suburbs, the temperatures in Central Dubai rarely fall below 7 °C (45 °F). This can be clearly seen 
                    when comparing weather data from the city's two airports - Dubai International and Dubai World Central. 
                    The highest temperature recorded in Dubai is 49.0 °C (120 °F), reached in July 2019,[1] whereas the 
                    lowest recorded
