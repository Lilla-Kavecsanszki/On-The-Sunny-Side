                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <br>
                <p>In terms of area, Morocco is comprised predominantly of "hot summer Mediterranean climate" (Csa) and
                    "hot desert climate" (BWh) zones.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Southeast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long
                    and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland
                    regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The
                    southeasternmost portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the Sahara Desert, where
                    vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush oases.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Atlas Mountains
                    In general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and
                    geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus Morocco has the following climate zones:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Mediterranean: Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500 km strip),
                    and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs are
                    between 29 °C (84.2 °F) and 32 °C (89.6 °F).
                </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Sub-Mediterranean: It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly
                    influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the
                    North Atlantic Ocean.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Oceanic: Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around 27 °C (80.6 °F) are almost always around 21 °C (69.8 °F).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Continental: Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers; daily highs can get as high as
                    40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F).
                    Summers are hot to very hot, with highs between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F).
