                <p>In terms of area, Morocco is comprised predominantly of "hot summer Mediterranean climate" (Csa) and
                    "hot desert climate" (BWh) zones.

                    Central mountain ranges and the effects of the cold Canary Current, off the Atlantic coast, are
                    significant factors in Morocco's relatively large variety of vegetation zones, ranging from lush
                    forests in the northern and central mountains, giving way to steppe, semi-arid and desert areas in
                    the eastern and southern regions. The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate
                    temperatures even in summer. On the whole, this range of climates is similar to that of Southern
                    California.

                    In the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates:
                    Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher
                    elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss
                    carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree endemic to Morocco. In the
                    valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud
                    forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher
                    elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.

                    Southeast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long
                    and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland
                    regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The
                    southeasternmost portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the Sahara Desert, where
                    vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush oases.

                    In contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal plains are fertile in the central and
                    northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which
                    95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to
                    mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather
                    European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes Morocco a country of
                    contrasts. Forested areas cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%.
                    Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.

                    Atlas Mountains
                    In general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and
                    geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus Morocco has the following climate zones:

                    Mediterranean: Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500 km strip),
                    and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs are
                    between 29 °C (84.2 °F) and 32 °C (89.6 °F). Winters are generally mild and wet, daily average
                    temperatures hover around 9 °C (48.2 °F) to 11 °C (51.8 °F), and average low are around 5 °C (41.0
                    °F) to 8 °C (46.4 °F), typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean. Annual Precipitation
                    in this area vary from 600 to 800 mm in the west to 350–500 mm in the east. Notable cities that fall
                    into this zone are Tangier, Tetouan, Al Hoceima, Nador and Safi.
                    Sub-Mediterranean: It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly
                    influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the
                    North Atlantic Ocean. We thus have two main influencing climates:
                    Oceanic: Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around 27 °C (80.6 °F) and in terms of
                    the Essaouira region, are almost always around 21 °C (69.8 °F). The medium daily temperatures can
                    get as low as 19 °C (66.2 °F), while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies
                    from 400 to 700 mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are Rabat, Casablanca, Kénitra, Salé and
                    Essaouira.
                    Continental: Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and
                    colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as
                    40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F).
                    However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below 20 °C (68.0 °F),
                    and sometimes as low as 10 °C (50.0 °F) in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the
                    freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also, snow can fall occasionally. Fès
                    for example registered −8 °C (17.6 °F) in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and
                    900 mm. Notable cities are Fès, Meknès, Chefchaouen, Beni-Mellal and Taza.
                    Continental: Dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where
                    summers are hot to very hot, with highs between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F). Winters on the
                    other hand are cold, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. And when cold damp air comes to
                    Morocco from the northwest, for a few days, temperatures sometimes get below −5 °C (23.0 °F). It
                    often snows abundantly in this part of the country. Precipitation varies between 400 and 800 mm.
                    Notable cities are Khenifra, Imilchil, Midelt and Azilal.
                    Alpine: Found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High
                    Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and
                    snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200 mm. In summer highs barely go above 30 °C (86.0
                    °F), and lows are cool and average below 15 °C (59.0 °F). In winters, highs average around 8 °C
                    (46.4 °F), and lows go well below the freezing point. In this part of country, there are many ski
                    resorts, such as Oukaimeden and Mischliefen. Notable cities are Ifrane, Azrou and Boulmane.
                    Semi-arid: This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of
                    the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350 mm. However,
                    one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern
                    and thermal attributes. Notable cities are Agadir, Marrakesh and Oujda.
                    South of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to
                    prevail.

                    Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two
                    phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by
                    7–8 degrees Celsius when sirocco blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures
                    by 7–8 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold
                    spell. However, these phenomena do not last for more than two to five days on average.

                    Countries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are Portugal, Spain
                    and Algeria and the U.S. state of California.

                    Climate change is expected to significantly impact Morocco on multiple dimensions. As a coastal
                    country with hot and arid climates, environmental impacts are likely to be wide and varied. As of
                    the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index, Morocco was ranked second in preparedness behind
                    Sweden.[69]</p>
