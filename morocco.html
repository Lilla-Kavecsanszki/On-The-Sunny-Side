                    <h2>Climate</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>In terms of area, Morocco is comprised predominantly of "hot summer Mediterranean climate" (Csa)
                        and
                        "hot desert climate" (BWh) zones.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Southeast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with
                        long
                        and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland
                        regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The
                        southeasternmost portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the Sahara Desert,
                        where
                        vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush oases.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Atlas Mountains
                        Morocco's climate and
                        geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus Morocco has the following climate
                        zones:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Mediterranean: Dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500 km
                        strip),
                        and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs
                        are
                        between 29 °C (84.2 °F) and 32 °C (89.6 °F).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Sub-Mediterranean: It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain
                        fairly
                        influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the
                        North Atlantic Ocean.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Oceanic: Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around 27 °C (80.6 °F) are almost
                        always
                        around 21 °C (69.8 °F).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Continental: Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter
                        summers;
                        daily highs can get as high as
                        40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F).
                        Summers are hot to very hot, with highs between 32 °C (89.6 °F) and 36 °C (96.8 °F).
