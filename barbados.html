                <p>
                    The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall.
                    Known as the "wet season", this period runs from June to December. By contrast, the "dry season"
                    runs
                    from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between 1,000 and 2,300 mm (40 and 90 in). From
                    December to May the average temperatures range from 21 to 31 °C (70 to 88 °F), while between June
                    and
                    November, they range from 23 to 31 °C (73 to 88 °F).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the Köppen climate classification scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a tropical monsoon
                    climate (Am). However, breezes of 12 to 16 km/h (7 to 10 mph) abound throughout the year and give
                    Barbados a climate which is moderately tropical.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, landslips, and hurricanes. Barbados lies outside the
                    principal Atlantic hurricane belt and is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical
                    storms and hurricanes during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean
                    region
                    puts the country just outside the principal hurricane strike zone. On average, a major hurricane
                    strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage
                    to
                    Barbados was Hurricane Janet in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by Hurricane Tomas, but this
                    caused
                    only minor damage across the country as it was only at Tropical Storm level of formation.
