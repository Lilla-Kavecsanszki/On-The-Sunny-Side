                        The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall.
                        Known as the "wet season", this period runs from June to December. By contrast, the "dry season"
                        runs
                        from December to May. Annual precipitation ranges between 1,000 and 2,300 mm (40 and 90 in).
                        From
                        December to May the average temperatures range from 21 to 31 °C (70 to 88 °F), while between
                        June
                        and
                        November, they range from 23 to 31 °C (73 to 88 °F).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        On the Köppen climate classification scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a tropical monsoon
                        climate (Am). However, breezes of 12 to 16 km/h (7 to 10 mph) abound throughout the year and
                        give
                        Barbados a climate which is moderately tropical.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, landslips, and hurricanes. Barbados lies outside
                        the
                        principal Atlantic hurricane belt and is often spared the worst effects of the region's tropical
                        storms and hurricanes during the rainy season. Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean
                        region
                        puts the country just outside the principal hurricane strike zone. On average, a major hurricane
                        strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe
                        damage
                        to
                        Barbados was Hurricane Janet in 1955; in 2010 the island was struck by Hurricane Tomas, but this
                        caused
                        only minor damage across the country as it was only at Tropical Storm level of formation.
